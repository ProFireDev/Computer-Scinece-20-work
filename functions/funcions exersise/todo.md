**Methods and Functions Exercises**

For this assignment you will need to create the following functions such that they meet the criteria described. Note that correct spelling of each function and parameter is critical, they must match what I have given **exactly** (otherwise the testing program will have issues and give you a zero).

This assignment may only be submitted **once**, so double check to make sure everything works before you submit it. In order to verify that your code is correct, you should use {deadlink} to test your functions. For this testing program to work, you'll need to place it in the same folder as your assignment. After that, open and run the testing program as you would any other program and it will test your functions and give feedback. Be sure to test your programs yourself prior to using the testing program to make sure that your functions can run without error. I will be using *almost* the same program to mark your assignment, so the mark the testing software gives you will be the same as the mark I give you (unless you try to game the testing software of course).

0) Create a new program and name it **FunctionsExercise**
1) Write a function called **subNumbers** that subtracts 2 numbers and returns the result. Note, if given decimal numbers, it should round the result to 3 decimal places. (The [round()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_round.asp) function will be useful here)

Parameters: Num1,Num2

Output: a number

---

2) Write a function called **isEven** that checks if a number is even. (the [modulo](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-modulo-operator-what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-python-solved/) (%) operator will be useful here)

Parameters: Number

Output: True/False

---

3) Write a function called **isCapitalized** that checks if a word is capitalized. (String [operations](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp) and [methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) will be useful here)

Parameters: Word

Output: True/False

---

4) Write a function called **isMultiple** that checks if the first number is a multiple of the second number. (Modulo will be applicable here too)

Parameters: Number, MultipleOf

Outputs: True/False

---

5) Write a function called **Sum** that adds together every number from the second parameter to the first parameter. The second parameter should be optional and default to 1. (I recommend using a For loop for this)

Parameter: UpTo, StartFrom (optional)

Output: a number

---

6) Write a function called **datingRange** that takes in the person’s age and returns the youngest and oldest ages the user should consider dating based on the old rule of “Half your age plus seven” for the youngest. (use your algebra skills to solve for the oldest)

Parameter: Age

Output: lower and upper ages as integers (In that order)
