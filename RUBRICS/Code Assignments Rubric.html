<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Code Assignments Rubric</span></strong></p>
<p>Below is the rubric I will be using to mark your code:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Does the code start without crashing?</p>
<p>Can the code complete the basics if given good inputs?</p>
<p>Are the extra elements present?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the extra elements work as intended?</p>
<p>Can I crash the program with bad inputs? (This only applies to programs that get external input (from the user or a file))</p>
<p>End user experience (gives meaningful feedback to bad inputs, accepts variety of good inputs (Y,yes,Yes,y), intuitive interface etc. )?</p>
<p>Is there any orphan code? (code that doesn't run/not part of the main program, leftover from debugging etc.)</p>
<p>Is the code excessively bulky, inefficient or hard to follow? (Lots of repeated code, poor readability, not well commented etc.)</p>
<p>To what degree does the code show mastery of the central subject of the assignment (functions, arrays, files etc.)? (Are only the basic aspects employed or does the student use more advanced aspects?)</p>
<p>Is there extra elements not assigned that the students added on their own? (Add your own personal touch to your programs)</p>
