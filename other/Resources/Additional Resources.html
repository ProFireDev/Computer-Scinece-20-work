<p>There are an immense amount of resources available to programmers of all types and skill levels to be found online. Here are some of the most popular:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_self">StackOverflow</a>&nbsp;- This website is dedicated to providing a place for programmers to ask questions and get answers from other programmers. Whatever problem your facing, you're almost certainly not the first one to face it and so searching here can often help you find answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> - This website is a treasure trove of code for just about anything you can imagine. Here you can find code written and optimized by other programmers. It is a good place to find modules and subroutines for your project without spending the time to code and optimize it yourself. However this approach has the risk that the more of other people's code you incorporate, the less you understand how your program works. This can make it very difficult to find and correct bugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Important:</strong></span> Copying someone else's code in an academic setting (such as this class) is considered plagiarism and will result in your assignment not being marked. GitHub can still be a useful resource for examples to help understand how to accomplish something and how to structure your program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there is extensive documentation for each programming language. You can find the documentation available for Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here,</a><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp" target="_blank">&nbsp;here</a><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>, and&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Finally, Python makes extensive use of libraries to expand it's functionality. Documentation for the standard library that is available to everyone can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The Math and Random libraries may be of particular interest as Math includes many mathematical operations not normally available while Random gives enhanced options for creating randomized elements.&nbsp;</p>
