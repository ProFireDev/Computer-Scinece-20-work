#### Computer Science 20: Final Project

The final project in Computer Science 20 is an opportunity for students to independently develop an in-depth project that demonstrates the extent of their learning and capabilities. The goal of the project is for the student to identify a specific programming goal, progress through the design process, complete a working prototype of the program, receive feedback and engage in reflection on the process. At the conclusion of the project, each student should have a design project portfolio that will demonstrate their abilities in computer science.

**Project Proposal:**

The project will begin with a project proposal that must be approved by the teacher before the student may go ahead with the project. The purpose of the proposal is for the student to clearly communicate their goals so as to ensure that their project is (a) of sufficient scope to meet the curricular needs of the course, (b) not beyond the student’s ability in difficulty or ambition, and (c) properly considered with regard to details, and the appropriateness of the project for the classroom environment.

**Project Proposal Checklist:**

• Includes a summary of the project idea. This is a brief description of the project and a basic explanation of the key design features of the program.

• Includes two lists of the program components: A list of essential algorithms and properties and a list of “nice to have” features that can be added if there is sufficient time.

• Includes a timeline detailing the schedule over which development of the entire project (not just the programming) will occur.

• Includes an explanation of how the student will demonstrate mastery of Python in general as well as **methods**, **arrays**, **file streaming and object classes** specifically.

#### **Choosing a Project**

Inspiration can come from anywhere. Often, it is difficult for programmers to come up with an interesting idea that can meet all of the outcomes. A good place to start is with something that you are interested in and then ask, “What if…”? Try not to exclude any idea unless it is clearly untenable but also try not to get stuck on any single idea either. Allow your mind to be flexible and dynamic.

Try to keep the following in mind:

• Keep the difficulty realistic – try not to make it too difficult or too easy.

• Try to make the project meaningful for you. This will allow you to become personally invested in the project itself.

• The project must be of sufficient scope that you can demonstrate the extent of your knowledge and abilities.

• The project must be tailored to a specific audience or user. Is it meant to be played by gamers? If so, then how old are they? What kind of gamer are you appealing to? Is it a business application? Is it for big business or small business? How many customers/employees would they have?

• You may get advice from others but collaborating on the project – especially the programming portion is forbidden.

## **Design Document Project Sections:**

Each milestone must have its own section in the design document and should be arranged in the order shown. Each portion of the project must be completed before the programming portion takes place. DO NOT REVERSE ENGINEER THE DESIGN PROCESS BY PROGRAMMING FIRST AND THEN “PLANNING” AFTERWARDS!

**1. **Ana**lysis** – In this section, the student is meant to define and design the program. They must start by clearly stating the goals, the essential elements of the project as well as the optional additions that may be added if time permits. Indicators of success that describe the minimal functionality of the final product should be included where appropriate.

**2. **Pre**liminary Design** – In this section, the design must be refined and each part of the problem/project must be clearly broken down into its components. Some form of planning diagram (i.e. a flowchart, top down hierarchical breakdown or other diagram) should be included. At this stage of the design process, each non-trivial method should be described – including a general description of its purpose, process, parameters and return type. A decision about the types of data structures (list, tuple, dictionary etc.) used to hold non-trivial data should be explicitly explained at this point as well. A sample user interface (UI) should be diagrammed and a list of user friendly features should be made.

**3. **The Pro**gram** – The program code must be included in the design document

The code should demonstrate:

• Good programming style, meaning the code is easily readable, even by a programmer who has never used the program. These would include small and clearly structured Python methods, sufficient and appropriate comments, meaningful identifier names and a consistent indentation scheme.

• A typical program should be approximately 75–750 lines of code in length.

• Comments should be included to describe the purpose and parameters of each method, and also when code is difficult to understand.

• Handling errors: This refers to detecting and rejecting erroneous data input from the user, and preventing common run-time errors caused by calculations and data-file errors.

**4. Evaluation** – a review of the finished product should be included. This review should include a reflection on the initial design parameters and indicators of success. It should also include feedback from test users and notes on revisions made and ideas for future revisions. You should ask question such as:

* Did it work?
* Did it address the criteria for success?
* Does the program in its current form have any limitations?
* What additional features could the program have?
* Was the initial design appropriate?
* What would you have done differently?

**5. Reflection:**

* What were your perceptions of computer science at the beginning of the course and how have they changed?
* How could a knowledge of programming be useful in the future?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of relying on technology to address social issues?
* How has understanding of how computers work affected how you view and interact with technology?

###### **Your final submission should include both your design document as described above as well as your program.**
