#### **computer science 20 final project proposal**

---



**The short  proposal:**

MP3 player and file manager combo - see below

The project will begin with a project proposal that must be approved by the teacher before the student may go ahead with the project. The purpose of the proposal is for the student to clearly communicate their goals so as to ensure that their project is

**(a) of sufficient scope to meet the curricular needs of the course,**

Reading over the generic rubric, it should be.

**(b) not beyond the student’s ability in difficulty or ambition, and**

It shouldn't be, I have a fair bit of experience with programming and python in general. I've just been neglecting this class, but I'm making a comeback.

**(c) properly considered with regard to details, and the appropriateness of the project for the classroom environment.**

##### **Project Proposal Checklist:**

• Includes a summary of the project idea. This is a brief description of the project and a basic explanation of the key design features of the program.

I would like to create an MP3 player, kinda like if you took spotify and apple music and had a weird crossover. It also will include some type of basic file manager to help you kinda organize tracks and stuff ( ie maybe a playlist is just a subfolder of music it plays from) the UI will be using a cross between tinker because i have lots of experience with it, and pygame. If there's time maybe the UI will look somewhat decent by the end. I'm not sure how good it's going to look. See the timeline below for a better explanation of how it will be laid out.

• Includes two lists of the program components: A list of essential algorithms and properties and a list of “nice to have” features that can be added if there is sufficient time.

**Nice to haves:**

* Discord rich presence integration?
* Maybe a proper .exe installer? (code will be separate and run without it)
* It would be nice to be able to rename files and stuff in the app and move them around.
* Maybe there could be an example of how to stream from a server, all the basic code could be there, just no server to stream from.

### Essential stuff:

* It will have to be able to look at mp3’s and play them and do all that stuff
* There would be math involved for the times
* Pygame and tiker for the ui
* Maybe some other module for the “backend” behind the ui to help with playback
* It would be nice to play pause, shuffle and skip tracks. Track lengths would also be cool. (displaying time left and stuff) think of an itunes clone with less features type of thing)
* A search bar to look through the files if you want to play a certain track would be cool
* Lots of comments, not just in the commits
* Not too sure of the exact algorithms I will use, but I don't think I will need to use any for anything but the timestamps and the shuffle play.

I'm thinking of tracks. Maybe I just index how many there are in an array or something with a track ID and then randomly pick from that in respect to the currently selected track?


* It would be nice to keep track of the point you are at in the current track so if you close the program you don't have to restart, but this is a secondary thing

• Includes a timeline detailing the schedule over which development of the entire project (not just the programming) will occur.


1. I would like to start off over with the first few days kinda researching and looking around to help work on this kind of project.


1. Do the basic coding and get the ui all set up
4. Move on to getting the “backend” features like playback working
5. Do a lot of debugging and find edge cases that might of not been known before
6. Make some new notes on the document about project
7. Regroup and see how the work is going and see what next steps need to be taken
8. Finalize project and finally update document with what happened
9. Possible testing with other people to see what they think? -- go from there to see what else can be done
10. Finalize write up and reflection and hand in


This should be the mostly finalized timeline, actual final project might be dumbed down a bit.

-- might add a real timeline graph thing here, but as always timelines are subject to change before the hard deadline. That's the only thing set in stone.

• Includes an explanation of how the student will demonstrate mastery of **Python in general as well as methods, arrays, file streaming and object classes specifically.**


Just generally laying this out:


File streaming / manipulation. is a core part of the program.

I believe that object classes are an essential part of tinker and pygame, so no issues there, because I will have to use them.

For methods, just like any program there will be functions to do different things, and the built in python methods will most likely be used somewhere.

Since this was one of your examples, I kinda just took the two, added some things I really like, this is something I have always wanted to do as well on my own because I really like music, so it gives me a reason to just do it.

Going to most likely incorporate some kind of array or dictionary to keep track of the tracks and where they are for the whole track playing system too. There's more under the main scope above

Just by the general design and nature of how complex this program can get, I think it's a good fit to show my understanding of this class. It should use basically everything we have covered so far.

Even though this has been a brief and basic explanation of the project, I think for the rough draft and outline this is a good and detailed proposal that includes a bit of everything. Some things may be optimistic and get left out in the nice to haves, but overall this is really do-able.

More will be a part of the design document, since this is digital in that document I will include a link back to hear, and when that document is done I will put a link to this on in it too.
