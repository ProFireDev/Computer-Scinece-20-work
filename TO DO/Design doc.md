#### Design Document Project Sections:

---

Each milestone must have its own section in the design document and should be arranged in the order shown. Each portion of the project must be completed before the programming portion takes place. DO NOT REVERSE ENGINEER THE DESIGN PROCESS BY PROGRAMMING FIRST AND THEN “PLANNING” AFTERWARDS!

***currently a basic outlline, the oriogional one on google docs will be pasted in here when its done***


**currently the proposal is the plan on what to do, look under essential things**

**1. **Ana**lysis** – In this section, the student is meant to define and design the program. They must start by clearly stating the goals, the essential elements of the project as well as the optional additions that may be added if time permits. Indicators of success that describe the minimal functionality of the final product should be included where appropriate.


**2. **Pre**liminary Design** – In this section, the design must be refined and each part of the problem/project must be clearly broken down into its components. Some form of planning diagram (i.e. a flowchart, top down hierarchical breakdown or other diagram) should be included. At this stage of the design process, each non-trivial method should be described – including a general description of its purpose, process, parameters and return type. A decision about the types of data structures (list, tuple, dictionary etc.) used to hold non-trivial data should be explicitly explained at this point as well. A sample user interface (UI) should be diagrammed and a list of user friendly features should be made.


**3. **The Pro**gram** – The program code must be included in the design document

**The code should demonstrate:**

• Good programming style, meaning the code is easily readable, even by a programmer who has never used the program. These would include small and clearly structured Python methods, sufficient and appropriate comments, meaningful identifier names and a consistent indentation scheme.

• A typical program should be approximately 75–750 lines of code in length.

• Comments should be included to describe the purpose and parameters of each method, and also when code is difficult to understand.

• Handling errors: This refers to detecting and rejecting erroneous data input from the user, and preventing common run-time errors caused by calculations and data-file errors.


**4. Evaluation** – a review of the finished product should be included. This review should include a reflection on the initial design parameters and indicators of success. It should also include feedback from test users and notes on revisions made and ideas for future revisions. You should ask question such as:

* Did it work?
* Did it address the criteria for success?
* Does the program in its current form have any limitations?
* What additional features could the program have?
* Was the initial design appropriate?
* What would you have done differently?


**5. Reflection:**

* What were your perceptions of computer science at the beginning of the course and how have they changed?
* How could a knowledge of programming be useful in the future?
* What are some advantages and disadvantages of relying on technology to address social issues?
* How has understanding of how computers work affected how you view and interact with technology?
